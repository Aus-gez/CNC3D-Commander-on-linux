# CNC3D-Commander-on-linux
How to get the CNC 3D software Commander running on Linux.

## What is Commander?
CNC3D is an Australian based store for various maker products (eg: CNC, 3D printers etc...). 

They use software for their propiatary CNC Nighthawk Controller. That software is called Commander. Unfortunately their software is designed for Windows (and Mac I think).

So figured out what was required to get the software working in Wine on Linux.

## What platforms has this been tested on?
A short list, to be sure.

* Ubuntu 20.04

## What works?
So far, everything that I've tested.

## The script
Sorry, this isn't done yet.

## The manual process
1. Install Wine (latest stable is fine).
2. Install wine tricks.
3. Create a wine prefix for Commander.
    * I like a gui for interacting with wine prefixes. So I use Q4Wine. You can use that to create the wine prefix, and carry out the below steps. 
4. Using wine tricks, install the latest dotnet 4.x package you have.
5. Install all the fonts you can under winetricks.
